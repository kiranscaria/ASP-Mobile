Port the awesomeness of Arxiv Sanity Preserver in your mobile phone :grin:


There are tons of papers already on Arxiv, many continue to be added each day. It is not only hard to cope up with the large number of new papers, but also time-consuming :weary:.  [**Arxiv-Sanity-Preserver**](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/) set out to help us with this problem. We are trying to take this a step further to add the accessibility of our mobile phones to it. More features will be added on the go. :sweat_smile:
